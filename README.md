California Crime:

This project has two parts:
- Map based representation:
The map has three options to visualize data:
1) By crime allows you to choose points on the map and displays details on the sidebar.
2) By area allows you to choose the district you want to see crime instances in and displays them.
3) By drawing allows you to draw a circle on the map and displays all occurrences of crime inside the circle.

-Graph based representation:
1) Graph1 displays number of crimes by hour of the day and allows you to choose day of the week.
2) Graph2 displays number of crimes by weekday.
3) Graph3 displays number of crimes by hour of the day only.


Attn:
Because of the huge dataset used, initial loading of the map takes some time. You can tell loading is complete when points appear on the map.

To access the graphs, download the graph#.html files along with the graphfiles folder.
